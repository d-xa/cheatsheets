**Theorem 1** Compute conditional probability using a conjunction:
```{math}
:label: theorem1
w_{t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) s(w_t) + y_{t+1}
```

**Theorem 2** Compute a conjunction using conditional probability:
```{math}
:label: theorem2
w_{t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) s(w_t) + y_{t+1}
```

**Theorem 3** Bayes Theorem - to get $P(B|A)$ from $P(A|B)$:

```{math}
:label: theorem3
w_{t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) s(w_t) + y_{t+1}
```
